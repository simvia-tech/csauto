## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-08

Add `csauto control` for live case steering (stop/extend/checkpoint/flush) as a non-destructive alternative to killing a running case.

### Added
- `csauto control` command for live case steering: `--stop` (graceful stop with checkpoint), `--extend N` (raise the time step limit by N without restarting), `--checkpoint` (checkpoint now, keep running), `--flush` (flush logs/time plots now), plus a matching `POST /api/control_case` endpoint
- Status panel gains a Stop button and a More menu (Extend, Checkpoint, Flush) for running cases, with toast notifications on success

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

Add a `csauto doe` command to generate `doe.csv` from a parameter spec, plus release automation improvements.

### Added
- `csauto doe` command to generate `doe.csv` from a TOML parameter spec, supporting factorial, Latin Hypercube (LHS), Sobol (requires the `doe` extra), and central composite (CCD) sampling
- Automatic GitHub release creation when `VERSION` changes on `main`

### Fixed
- Tests no longer send real telemetry pings
- Release workflow now gates on CI success

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-06

Fix DOE CSV parsing to tolerate whitespace around headers and values.

### Added
-

### Fixed
- DOE CSV files with spaces around delimiters (e.g. after a comma) or leading/trailing whitespace on headers and values are now parsed correctly; whitespace is stripped before column matching and value casting, while spaces inside quoted values are preserved.
